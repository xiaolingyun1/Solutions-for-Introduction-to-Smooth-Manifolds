\begin{problem}
    Prove Lemma 8.6 (the extension lemma for vector fields).
    \begin{proof}
        The proof follows exactly the same procedure as Lemma 2.26, with the only difference being that we replace functions with vector fields.
    \end{proof}

\begin{problem}
    \textbf{Euler's Homogeneous Function Theorem.} Let $c$ be a real number, and let $f \colon \mathbb{R}^n \setminus \{0\} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a smooth function that is positively homogeneous of degree $c$, meaning that
    $f(\lambda x) = \lambda^cf(x)$ for all $\lambda > 0$ and $x \in \R \setminus \{0\}$. Prove that $Vf=cf$, where $V$ is the Euler vector field defined in Example 8.3.

\begin{problem}
    Let $M$ be a nonempty positive-dimensional smooth manifold with or without boundart. Show that $\mathfrak{X}(M)$ is infinite-dimensional.
